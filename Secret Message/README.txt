This program fetches data from a Google Docs document containing characters and their coordinates, then arranges these characters in a 3x4 grid to reveal a secret message. The data is processed by parsing the HTML content of the document, extracting the characters and their coordinates, and then placing them in the correct positions within the grid. When the program runs, it should display the letter F in the console, formed by the characters in the grid. The final secret message is displayed by printing each row of the grid.
